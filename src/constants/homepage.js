          I am excited to announce that we will be tying the knot soon, and I couldn't be more thrilled to start this new chapter in my life. Ever since we started dating in October 2015, my love for Praveen has only grown stronger with each passing day. He is my rock, my best friend, and the love of my life.
          We share many common interests, including our love for travel, food, and trying new experiences. But more than that, we share a deep connection and a commitment to building a life together filled with love, laughter, and joy.
